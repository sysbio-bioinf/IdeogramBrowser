IdeogramBrowser
===============

The IdeogramBrowser can be used to easily compare a set of output files from the Affymetrix Chromosome Copy Number Analysis Tool. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or loss/gain markers are plotted against their corresponding chromosomal region in a karyotypic representation together with genes.
